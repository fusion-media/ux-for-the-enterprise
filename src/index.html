            <p class="letter-salutation">Dear Fellow Shareholders,<br />Customers &amp; Employees</p>
            <p>IFF’s new purpose statement encapsulates 126 years of innovation and a deep-rooted ambition to explore new frontiers. It illuminates how, at the heart of our company, we are fueled by a sense of discovery, constantly asking “what if?” to address today’s challenges and envision tomorrow’s opportunities. This powerful statement grew out of our refreshed business strategy—Vision 2020—to ensure that we continue to lead where we compete and maintain our focus on what matters most: our customers, consumers, employees, and shareholders.</p>
            <p>Vision 2020 influences the way we do business. It guides our efforts to accelerate profitable growth, build greater differentiation and maximize shareholder value. When we communicated our long-term financial targets, established objectives to drive mergers and acquisitions, and improved our capital allocation distribution—we underscored our commitment to the strategy. Further, we reprioritized our expansive R&D initiatives, progressed our sustainability goals and recharged our story with a fresh brand platform and visuals.</p>
            <p>I am pleased to share that, along with these accomplishments, we delivered strong financial results. Due in large part to the diversity of our business and our recent acquisitions, we achieved 5% revenue growth, an 8% increase in adjusted operating profit and an 11% improvement in adjusted EPS growth&mdash;all on a currency neutral basis. We also increased our dividend by 20% and repurchased $1.1 million worth of our shares to reach a total payout ratio of adjusted net income of 66%—above our target range of 50 to 60%—and completed the cross-listing of our shares on Euronext Paris—an important step in facilitating broader ownership of IFF shares in the European capital markets.</p>
            <p>We are proud of our results, but we also know that the world around us is changing. We see the profound dynamics of an increasing and diverse population, unprecedented climate change, and pervasive market volatility. Our only choice is to adapt and to evolve. This is in our DNA—to be nimble, to adjust and to transform to meet the needs of a changing environment.</p>
            <p>Today is no different. We continue to thrive because we bring people together—employees, customers and partners—to create products that meet the present and future needs of consumers. Collaboration generates ideas and defines our role not only in the Flavors and Fragrances industry, but with adjacency businesses as well.</p>
            <p>Our Vision 2020 strategy consists of four pillars:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#firsts">Innovating Firsts</a></li>
                <li><a href="#win">Win Where We Compete</a></li>
                <li><a href="#choice">Becoming our Customers’ Partner of Choice</a></li>
                <li><a href="#portfolio">Strengthen and Expand the Portfolio</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>These pillars are rooted in our foundation of Talent and Organization, Continuous Improvement, and Sustainability.</p>
            <p>While still in its early stages, our Vision 2020 strategy has already realized several exciting accomplishments.</p>

            <h1>Innovating Firsts</h1>
            <div class="columns">
                <p class="intro">We understand and realize the future needs of our customers and consumers by building robust R&D platforms that deliver consumer-preferred solutions. Dedicated to driving differentiation, our goals for Vision 2020 are clear and achievable: for Fragrances, we aim to be the undisputed leader in delivery systems, new molecules and naturals; for Flavors, we are focused on modulation, delivery systems and naturals.</p>
                <p>Fragrance delivery systems via encapsulation remain a must-win platform because it provides the greatest opportunity across all categories. We are pioneers in this technology. In 2007, we launched our first encapsulation product for Fabric Care—a solid growth driver and key in differentiating brands we support. In 2015, our encapsulation-related sales increased to the mid-teens. We expect this success to continue as we enhance and evolve our technology and as we expand into new areas, such as personal care products.</p>
                <p>We are on our way to assume a leadership position in new molecule development by 2020. The resulting fragrance ingredients provide a greater competitive advantage for our perfumers to use in their business formulizations, and allow us increased differentiation among our peers. In 2015, we commercialized four captive fragrance ingredients—a 50% increase from our annual average over the last decade—providing greater confidence in our accelerated growth ambition. We also launched Amber Extreme™ —a previously captive fragrance ingredient— for broad use within the fragrance industry.</p>
                <p>We will strengthen our leadership position in naturals by continuing to develop responsible products. One route is to create innovative and unique specialty scents derived from natural ingredients. We will also expand our portfolio of key ”Living” ingredients—which are critical to the Fine Fragrance and Beauty Care categories—by sourcing new botanicals, mastering cultivation, and performing extraction. Our primary goal is to combine our focus on sustainable solutions and cost optimization.</p>
                <p>Combining IFF expertise in natural ingredients and our unique R&D pipeline with Lucas Meyer Cosmetics’ (LMC) cosmetics ingredients innovation has strengthened our product offerings – and enabled IFF to differentiate in the very attractive skin care and hair care segments. LMC has a strong commercialization pipeline of captive new molecules that comprises active ingredients, including anti-aging and anti-wrinkle formulations; functional ingredients, including emulsifiers and cooling effects; and delivery systems, including long lasting effects. In 2015, LMC commercialized 5 patented protected molecules demonstrating a robust pipeline that underscores that we are well-positioned to capture the growth potential in the short and long term.</p>
                <p>In Flavors, our aim is to address the consumers’ ever-growing need for health and wellness offerings. Today’s consumers are more proactive about their health than ever before and, as a result, our major customers are prioritizing modulation solutions. We are helping to meet this growing need. This year, we launched two natural modulators and our Savory and Sweet modulation technologies grew strong double-digits.</p>
                <p>Recent success with our proprietary delivery technology in Latin America—a region with strong double-digit growth in 2015—reveals that there is still room for innovative and cost-effective solutions. One exciting project on the horizon is a powder encapsulation system that delivers improved flavors at the lowest possible price.</p>

            <h1>Win Where We Compete</h1>
            <p class="intro">2015 was all about identifying key markets, categories and customers prime for growth.</p>
            <p>We initiated strategies across both our flavor and fragrance business units to achieve a leadership position in our home market of North America—a market with approximately $4 billion in potential. As part of this initiative and aligned with our renewed focus on M&A, we acquired Ottens Flavors and moved from #2 Flavors partner in North America. With a solid reputation for outstanding customer service and diverse flavor technologies, Ottens Flavors provides tremendous opportunities to leverage in the future.</p>
            <p>Our increased strategic efforts in the fast-growing economies of Africa and the Middle East reveal significant progress, including sales in the regions showing mid-teens growth on a currency neutral basis. We’ve also aligned our operations to fully support the efforts of our global customers who recognize the potential benefits of expanding into promising markets.</p>
            <p>We also turned our attention to specific value-enhancing categories, including Fine Fragrances and Home Care; and key growth customers across both business units. For Fine Fragrances, we will increase growth by focusing on fast-growing end-market customers, where we will concentrate on several fast-moving, smaller brands in order to increase our position.</p>
            <p>In Home Care, the largest consumer fragrance category in North America, we will leverage our global center of excellence to accelerate growth even more. This year, the category was up high-single-digits globally and mid-single-digits in North America, further evidence that our strategy is on the right track.</p>

            <h1>Becoming Our Customers' Partner of Choice</h1>
            <p class="intro">Commercial excellence—this is our goal. To achieve it, we are building upon our efforts to offer our customers in-depth and local consumer insights, industry-leading innovation, outstanding service, and the highest quality products available. This is how we remain an essential partner and provide incremental business opportunities for our customers and IFF.</p>
            <p>In 2015, we launched our refreshed branding —where we unveiled a new website, purpose statement, visual identity, and tone of voice. All of which are geared towards showcasing IFF’s vision, imagination, and innovative focus to customers, employees, and of course, shareholders.</p>
            <p>It was also a year of considerable progress —and customers took note. We won the North American Innovation Award for thought-leadership with one of our largest Flavors customers. In Fine Fragrance, we received a supplier excellence award—an achievement designed to honor top-performing business partners. Our recently acquired Lucas Meyers Cosmetics won the 2015 Gold Award for the Innovation Zone Best Active Ingredient at the renowned In-cosmetics Asia Conference.</p>
            <p>When it comes to winning future business, however, we know that it is imperative to stay on our customers’ core lists. We are achieving this by investing in our R&D capabilities, developing consumer insights, and expanding our understanding of regulatory requirements. In 2015, we reaffirmed or expanded our core list status with four key customers, including our largest Fragrance customer and two Flavors customers, one based in North America and the other global.</p>

        <h1>Strengthening and Expanding the Portfolio</h1>
        <p class="intro">Mergers and acquisitions, partnerships, and collaborations are essential to the success of Vision 2020 and to our overall portfolio. We are targeting opportunities—within our industry and near adjacencies—to develop new technologies and to expand our geographic and business opportunities. All of this must be done in a way that makes strong strategic sense and leverages our expertise in science and technology.</p>
        <p>The highlights of 2015 include two acquisitions and the signing of two R&D collaborations. These developments helped us power our portfolio across the businesses and throughout the regions in which we operate. Our acquisition of Ottens Flavors strengthened our operations in North America, improved our market share, and increased our ability to meet the needs of our regional accounts by leveraging their go-to-market strategy.</p>
        <p>We also expanded into a new business platform with the recently acquired Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, a company that develops, manufactures, and markets innovative ingredients for the cosmetics and personal care industry. This partnership combines the unique strengths and resources of both companies—our fragrance expertise, global commercial network, leadership in natural ingredients, and unique R&D pipeline with Lucas Meyer Cosmetics’ research and cosmetics ingredients innovation. As a result, we’ve increased our product offerings and are now one of our customer’s partners of choice in the expansive skin care and hair care segment.</p>
        <p>“Open innovation” is more than just a phrase at IFF, it’s a way of business. This is why we are working with our customers in a visionary capacity. We have already established collab-orations with fashion schools and leading academic institutions like Duke University and the University of Liverpool where we are exploring flavor modulation and fragrance delivery systems, respectively. Collaboration is the basis for good business and we are tenacious in our pursuit of strong partnerships.</p>
        <p>We are ambitious and we are capable. Our goal is to add $500 million to $1 billion in additional sales by the year 2020. These opportunities will allow us to tap into areas of expertise beyond the walls of IFF, leading to sustainable growth.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section section--talent" id="talent">
        <h1>Building Our Talent Pipeline</h1>
        <p class="intro">2015 was the year we experienced the benefits of our fully integrated talent architecture. Talent development is a top priority at IFF and a key enabler to our Vision 2020 strategy and beyond. In an industry filled with specialized roles, it is critical that we support our employees in both their technical and leadership capabilities to build long-lasting careers. Our global integrated talent process prepares employees for the opportunities of tomorrow and differentiates our talent in a competitive market.</p>
        <h2>Workforce Planning</h2>
        <p>As part of Vision 2020, we shaped a Workforce Planning Roadmap that defines the talent requirements necessary to deliver our future strategy. A core element of the workforce plan is to predict required profiles in IFF’s most critical skillsets. This insight then guides and focuses talent mapping and talent acquisition into the most important areas.</p>
        <h2>Pipeline Schools</h2>
        <p>We built and enhanced our internal technical schools and leadership programs to ensure we provide best-in-class training and a steady talent pipeline.</p>
        <p>Over the last 15 years, our Perfumery School selected and prepared many successful perfumers, leveraging a rigorous curriculum and guidance from IFF’s expert “noses.” In 2015, we refreshed the curriculum and delivery model to meet the complexity of being a perfumer in a rapidly changing global environment.</p>
        <p>We also celebrated the first graduating class of our Flavorist School, where participants built a greater understanding of flavors applications and developing creative techniques.</p>
        <p>In 2015, we launched our new Scent Design School and successfully graduated our first class. Students develop olfactive skills and gain an understanding of consumer insights, creative strategy, finance and project management, preparing them fully for this critical role.</p>
        <p>Lastly, we designed the first-ever R&D academy in 2015, where participants strengthen their business and finance acumen, learn frameworks and tools to extend innovation beyond the lab and enhance project planning and execution skills.</p>
        <h2>Leadership Development</h2>
        <p>Capitalizing on our existing Mastering Business Agility program, which is delivered in partnership with the INSEAD Graduate Business School, we are graduating our third class of high-potential global leaders. To date, over half of our graduates have been promoted at least once and others have had significant expansion of their roles.</p>
        <h2>Recruiting</h2>
        <p>We launched a comprehensive social media recruitment strategy that allows us to target and engage with top talent—not just active job-seekers. Social media enables us to develop relationships with candidates early on, so that IFF is top-of-mind when they consider making their next career move.</p>
        <p>By penetrating more deeply into the external talent pool using our mobile-enabled careers page, posting on niche job-boards, and partnering with new vendors, we have increased the diversity of our candidate pools. This is great news for IFF as we hire the employees who will continue to deliver global solutions to global customers.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section section--future" id="future">
        <h1>Creating a Sustainable Future</h1>
        <p class="intro">Sustainability and innovation—at IFF, they work together. Our sustainability strategy involves both social and environmental improvements—from the raw materials we source responsibly to our eco-efficient manufacturing facilities to the carefully designed products that consider critical sustainability attributes. Increasingly, customers and consumers are demanding responsible products from conscientious companies throughout the supply chain. We think this is a good thing and we are doing our part by focusing on important sustainability issues such as global climate change, water scarcity, increasing world population, and health & wellness.</p>
        <p>2015 was a year of sustainability for IFF. Our accomplishments were extensive. We were recognized by the CDP for a perfect score in carbon management: 100 in disclosure and an “A” in performance, which puts us in the top 5% of companies worldwide. We demonstrated a commitment to a low carbon global economy by supporting the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris. Leading up to this event, we showed action leadership by joining the 100% Renewable Energy effort and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. We also signed President Obama’s American Business Act on Climate Pledge and Pope Francis’ encyclical “On Care for Our Common Home,” and confirmed our commitment to the UN Global Compact’s universal sustainability principles.</p>
        <p>We are proud to be considered a responsible and reliable company in our customers’ supply chains. This year we demonstrated industry leadership by joining Together for Sustainability. We also achieved Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil certification in multiple facilities and gained For Life certification for Turkish rose, patchouli, basil, and vetiver. Our manufacturing facilities surpassed our corporate-wide 2020 water reduction goal of 25%, so we set a new goal for a 50% reduction by 2020. We also began construction of the industry’s first major wind turbine at our facility in Tilburg, the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>We are excited by the progress we have made in 2015 and look forward to future opportunities as we work to further embed sustainability throughout IFF and our entire value chain.</p>
